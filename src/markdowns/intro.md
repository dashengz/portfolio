# Hey there, <br>Jonathan here!

I’m an NYC-based **Application Developer** who’s well-versed in front-end design and development as well as back-end scripting and database management.

I received my Master’s degree in **Education Technology**, and I believe that just like technology can transform and elevate our learning experience, learning theories and user studies are also crucial for creating better technology.
