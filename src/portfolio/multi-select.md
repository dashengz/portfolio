**Google Sheets's built-in Data Validation** feature allows users to set up certain criteria for cell ranges, which is really helpful when users want the data to be consistent and without accidental user errors.

However, **one major disappointment** for a lot of the users is the **lack of support for multiple values selection**.

For example, if a user has defined the following tags: "Web App", "React", "Front-end" and "Back-end", it's not really possible to label a project as both "Web App" and "Front-end" with the built-in Data Validation feature, not without some time-consuming workaround methods, such as creating different combinations of choices.

**"Multi-select Data Validation" add-on for Google Sheets** is a perfect tool for users with the need to select multiple values from a predefined range. The user can easily add and modify ranges, select the checkboxes and apply corresponding values to the currently selected cell in a breeze.

Enjoy the productivity brought to you by this cool add-on! Please do let me know if you run into any bugs or if you have any suggestions :)
